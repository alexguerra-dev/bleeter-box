> Idea: Make a square that plays when you hover over it. Maybe, when you click it it changes tunes.

## Day Two

Sometimes it is hard to keep a project going. Especially, when it is a learning project.
I have a tendency to make many little useless projects. I should work on having many small parts to a single project.

## Things I am _aloud_ to do to waste time

- Work on making my editor pretty.[^2]
- Read the docs.
  - [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
  - [React](https://react.dev/)
  - [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/docs)
  - [Tailwinds](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/)
  - [Max MSP](https://docs.cycling74.com/)
  - [RNBO](https://rnbo.cycling74.com/)

[^2]: This is probably something that I should not allow myself to do.
