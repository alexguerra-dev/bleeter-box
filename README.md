## Day Two

Sometimes it is hard to keep a project going. Especially, when it is a learning project.
I have a tendency to make many little useless projects. I should work on having many small parts to a single project.

## Things I am _aloud_ to do to waste time

- Work on making my editor pretty.[^2]
- Read the docs.
  - [Javascript]()
  - [React]()
  - [NextJs]()
  - [Max MSP]()
  - [RNBO]()
